# Java_LightsOutSolver
A simple text-based solver of the classic game LightsOut, made on Java.

LightsOut.java contains the main() method. Enter in cmd as String args[] the size of the gameboard, then the program will generate all possible solutions for the board size entered.
True means click, false means do not click.

This project also contains the GameModel class, so that a GUI could be implemented later on.
Once GUI is implemented, this project will be a full LightsOut game with a "Solve" button that just solves the game for the user.
